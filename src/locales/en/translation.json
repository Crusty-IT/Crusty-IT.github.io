My strengths are quickly picking up new tools, communication, documentation, and a constant drive to learn. I‚Äôm open to remote roles - not only DevOps but also administration/systems and related areas. I‚Äôm looking for a place where I can bring value from day one while growing my cloud and automation skills.",
